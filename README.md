# 🐾 Hyathi Pokemon Center 

Welcome to the **Hyathi Pokemon Center** – a fun little project where your favorite Pokémon are waiting to be adopted, fed, and loved! 💖

Imagine a world where each Pokémon you adopt becomes part of your personal team – you can feed them, earn coins, and unlock magical rewards like fairy dust. Whether you're a casual fan or a nostalgic 90s kid, this app brings a playful twist to the Pokémon universe. ⚡

This isn't just about catching them all – it's about *caring* for them. 🥺💕
